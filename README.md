# ACE Management Portal Project

![MANAGEMENTPORTAL](images/acesmall.png)

The ACE Management Portal consists of two components, the Management and Call Detail Record (CDR) dashboards. These dashboards present the manager with information about the operations of the call center and information about incoming calls.  

## SSL Configuration

1. ACE software uses SSL which requires a valid key and certificate.
1. The location of the SSL key and certificate is specified in the `dat/config.json` by using the `common:https:certificate` and `common:https:private_key` parameters in the form of folder/file (e.g., `/home/centos/ssl/mycert.pem` and `/home/centos/ssl/mykey.pem`).
1. Additional information can be found in the ACE Direct Platform Release documentation.

## Getting Started

To install the management portal, follow the README.md file in the autoinstall folder. The instructions for manual install are also provided below for reference.

1. Clone this repository
1. Download and install or update [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Run the required build script: cd into the managementportal directory, run `npm run build`
1. To start the ACE Management Portal node server manually, run `node server-db.js`

## Accessing the Portal

1. ACE Management Portal: `http://host/ManagementPortal`

## Management Dashboard

### Overview

The Management Dashboard provides the manager/supervisor with a view of multiple **Key Performance Indicators** (or KPI's), all of which can be monitored in real time.

*Management Dashboard*

#### KPI Types

The dashboard provides **three** main types of Key Performance Indicators:

1. **Summary Data** - KPIs are a summary over all queues combined
1. **Queue Related KPIs** - KPIs are specific to each type of queue
1. **Agent Related KPIs** - KPIs are specific to each individual agent
1. **Resource Status KPIs** - KPIs related to the status of each service necessary for running ACE Direct

The data can be one of two types:

1. **Not Cumulative** - This only accounts for data that has been accumulated since the last restart of the Management Portal server
1. **Cumulative** - This data accounts for any and all data up to and including the current management session
